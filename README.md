# Prerequisites

This project doesn't really know how to do things without CUDA (I think).
It uses the highest level APIs I could find to do the things.

1. Dependencies:
```script
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

# Usage

Run one of the scripts in the repo:

    app.py  Will display an app that does "real-time" transcription of input from the microphone.

    asr.app.py  Will show a web page with a "click the microphone button" type of transcription controls.

    microphone_interface.py    A toy web page that uses numpy to reverse a recording from the microphone.
